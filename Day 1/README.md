# Web Scraping with Docker

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to set up a web scraping application using Docker. The application uses Python and BeautifulSoup to scrape data from a specified website. Docker is used to containerize the application, making it easy to deploy and run.

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of Python and web scraping

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:
- **Dockerfile**: Defines the environment for the web scraping application.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python packages needed for the web scraping application.
- **app.py**: Contains the web scraping script.
- **README.md**: Provides instructions for setting up and running the project.

## Building and Running the Docker Container
### Step 1: Build the Docker Image
Use Docker to build the image for the web scraping application. This involves creating a Dockerfile that specifies the base image, working directory, and dependencies.

### Step 2: Run the Docker Container
Once the Docker image is built, run the container. This will start the web scraping application inside the container, making it accessible on a specified port.

## Accessing the Application
After running the container, you can access the web scraping application by navigating to the specified port on your local machine. The application will scrape data from the target website and display the results.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to containerize a web scraping application using Docker.
